    <h1>Fresh Southern Peach Cobbler</h1>
    <img src="../pics/peachCobb.webp" height="400" width="500"/>
    <p>This old-fashioned peach cobbler recipe uses fresh peaches and a buttery cobbler topping that's made form scratch. It's a delicious summer dessert I've perfected over the years!</p>
    <p>
        A cobbler — not to be confused with a crisp or crumble — is a deep-dish fruit dessert 
        with a sweetened fruit filling that is topped off with a biscuit-like dough. The dough
         may cover the entire dish or be dropped by the spoonful, earning it the name "cobbler" 
         for its resemblance to a cobblestone street. It gives you the same fruit-and-pastry 
         combination as pie, but without all the effort.
